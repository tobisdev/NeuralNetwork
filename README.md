# NeuralNetwork

NeuralNetwork is a C++ project that integrates a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) neural network capable of learning patterns, such as digits in images, using backpropagation and gradient descent. This project is designed to explore machine learning concepts and visualization techniques using SFML.

## Features

- **MLP Neural Network**: Implements a customizable multi-layer perceptron with support for backpropagation and gradient descent.
- **Visualization Tools**: Real-time visualization of network performance and learning process using SFML.
- **Interactive Interface**: Includes an interface for interacting with the AI and observing its behavior.

## Warning

The current code in the **miscellaneous** folder is not originally authored by me, as the CMake configuration still requires modification. Below are the referenced projects:

- [Dear ImGui](https://github.com/ocornut/imgui)
- [ImGui-SFML](https://github.com/eliasdaler/imgui-sfml)
- [SFML](https://github.com/SFML/SFML)

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up the project using CLion, MinGWw64, and SFML.

### Prerequisites

- **CLion**: Ensure CLion is installed on your system. [Download CLion](https://www.jetbrains.com/clion/download/)
- **MinGWw64**: Install the MinGWw64 compiler. [Download MinGW](http://mingw-w64.org/doku.php)
- **SFML**: Download and install SFML, a library for multimedia applications. [Download SFML](https://www.sfml-dev.org/download.php)

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tobisdev/NeuralNetwork.git
   cd NeuralNetwork
   ```

2. **Configure SFML**:
   - Set up the SFML environment in your system and ensure the necessary paths are correctly configured in the CMakeLists.txt file.

3. **Open in CLion**:
   - Launch CLion and open the `NeuralNetwork` directory.
   - CLion will automatically detect the CMake configuration.

4. **Build the Project**:
   - Click on the "Build" button in CLion to compile the project.
   - Resolve any dependencies or configuration issues if they arise.

5. **Run the Application**:
   - After a successful build, run the application directly from CLion.
   - Interact with the AI through the provided interfaces.
